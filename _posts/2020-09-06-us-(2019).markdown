Us is a mystery thriller by Jordan Peele about a family on vacation that is terrorized by an evil doppelganger family. While the summary is pretty succinct, it does describe the movie correctly, because everything else in it is forgettable or does not merit any extra attention.

It is hard to not compare Us to Get Out (2017), Jordan Peele’s debut feature film. In all the places where Get Out succeeds, Us fails. There is a no real tension in the movie, while Get Out had great build-up. At no point was I inclined to care about the characters. There is an attempt at some social commentary regarding class difference but it also does not really work.

The movie is also filled with references, for example to Hands Accross America or a biblical passage, but in the end they do not really amount to anything. The acting is also not helping, Lupita Nyong’o is having an especially bad performance. If you are looking for a smartly written mystery horror/thriller I would recommend watching Get Out again, because it set up a standard that Us is not able to rise to.
