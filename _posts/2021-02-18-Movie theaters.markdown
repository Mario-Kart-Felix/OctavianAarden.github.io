I am involved in a few communities related to movies. Regardless of the environment, there seems to be a prevailing opinion that movie theaters are the best medium to enjoy movies. We are not talking about the commercial, quick consumer fast-food movies. These are people that are into avantgarde movies, usually found in obscure theaters or only in the Criterion Collection. How far this is from my personal preferences.

I visit cinemas as often as your next door neighbor. If a movie like 1917 comes along I would like to enjoy it in a theater as my home system, good as it is, does not come close to the professional systems that you can enjoy for 10â‚¬ a movie. The opportunity to go to the movies as a social activity, to watch a bad horror with friends, or the new sequel to a movie you watched together as kid, yeah, count me in.

But going to the movies to enjoy a piece of art? Imagine seeing an Ingmar Bergman movie in the cinema, with people constantly pulling out their phones, whispering and popcorn eating? Why would you do that? For these reasons I am absolutely baffled by the cinephiles that think true cinema can only be enjoyed away from home in a crowded or shady cinema.
