While [Gerald’s Game](https://youtu.be/H3t_DuVHqBQ) has been entertaining and has kept a bit of suspense until the very end, it is far from being a great movie. A middle aged couple go off for a weekend to try and spice up their marriage only for the husband (Gerald) to have a heart attack while the wife (Jessie) is still tied to the bed and that is where the second act and the weird stuff starts to happen. Weird in a bad way in the case of this movie.

Hallucinations and flashbacks of childhood trauma flood the slowly dehydrating Jessie while she creeps closer and closer to her slow death. Some of the conversations with herself are indeed smartly written and bring a bit of savor to a situation that is inherently static. On the other hand, some of the flashbacks and the realizations that go through the main characters mind are incredibly dull and add nothing to the main story. Without giving away the final twist, which exists although it is not necessary and is there only to make the movie a horror, on top of a thriller and a drama, the handcuffs are a metaphor for the abuse Jessie has sustained from men in her life. While this should come as a surprise to no one, it does not make a lot of sense in the case of her husband, who is not really established as a bad guy, he is just trying hard to spice up the marriage, feed some of his fetishes and save the marriage.

The acting is not terrible and the atmospheric felling of the movie is decent, all in all these characteristic define a passable but forgettable film. For better similar thrillers/dramas with trapped characters I would recommend the superior [All Is Lost (2013)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2017038/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) or [127 Hours (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1542344/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0).
