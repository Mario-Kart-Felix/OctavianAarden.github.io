[The Autopsy of Jane Doe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtTAhXuiRTc) is a mystery supernatural horror that plays with one of human kinds worst fears, the dead and being close to them. The title basically gives away the plot of the movie: the local police force brings in a body and requests to have an autopsy by morning from the two coroners, a father and son played by Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch.

There are some brief scenes with the girlfriend and son, who comes to take him out for a date, but the son cannot leave his father to do such a complex, yet I guess usual for a coroner, task to completion?! The whole girlfriend subplot probably has the role of making us care about the characters, their desires and conflicts, but it did not really work as intended and only fells as wasted space.

The atmosphere is indeed claustrophobic. We follow an autopsy in a basement, which fells as if the trio formed by the father, son and Jane Doe, are already in a coffin. André Øvredal, the Norwegian director, has managed to create a sense of imminent doom with little riddles and old morticians myths, like hanging a small bell by the toes of the dead to make sure that they do not move anymore. Mysterious and paranormal events occur while they do their job, increasing in intensity as the movie moves on and circling back to the start where a lone body is found.

The plot is not really complex but the movie is a solid mystery supernatural horror that feels like it tries to go back to the basics of the horror genre. The desire to create tension by using the craft of cinema and not relying on cheap jump scares should be appreciated.
