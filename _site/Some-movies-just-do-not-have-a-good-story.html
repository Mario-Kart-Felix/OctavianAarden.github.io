    <p>As I have mentioned multiple times on twitter and here on my blog, I enjoy European film. The fact that the budgets are lower makes the movies made here a lot less dependent on the flashy stuff American films like to throw around like explosions and CGI.</p>

<p>With that said, I think it is also important to mention that I am not under the illusion that the European movie market or the European movie writer is in any way better than the North-American one. We do have our masterpieces as do they. What I do want to touch upon is the pretentiousness of depth in European film. Just because the writer was not able to write an interesting story, that does not mean that the elements that exist in the movie are in any way of higher value. No, the absence of a good story is just that, bad writing. It does not heighten the themes and metaphors of the movie.</p>

<p>I would like to take a classic example: The Godfather. It introduces a lot of themes, loyalty, tradition, the importance of family and many others. And yet this is all wrapped up in an amazing story that keeps even the people who are not interested in movies glued to the screen. Why is it then that with most low budget movies we sacrifice the story for the sake of a long dull character analysis. There is a really good chance that you will not make a lot of money with your movie, why then throw money and time away on poorly written scripts. At least make art out of it. Throw your character in an amazing adventure, make him act, that will really show his true character.</p>

<p>For any young writer out there that might read this, please do not get used to writing a boring story and expect the audience to admire your genius of having introduces references to obscure Japanese movies or to unknown soviet writers. Write an amazing story first, create tension, use classic archetypes in which most people will see themselves. If all these are not enough for you, then you can add all the decorative artifacts that will give you satisfaction. But please do not do it the other way around. If all else fails, look at mythology and pick a story from there. It is hard to fail at storytelling if you use stories that have been tested for thousand of years and people still eat them up like crazy.</p>

        <p>I have gained an increasing interest in storytelling in recent years. Movies, novels and even poetry fuel my imagination with the potential they have to influence others. No other medium is a close to translating toughts from one person to another as the written word and more recently the moving pictures. I write movie reviews with a focus on European film, short stories and toughts.</p>
