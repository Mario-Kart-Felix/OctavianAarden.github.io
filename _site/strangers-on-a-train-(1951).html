    <p>Strangers on a Train is the quintessential Hitchcock suspense drama. What starts off as a chance encounter on a train between a tennis player and what we will later find out to be a psychopath, spirals down into a life, death or prison situation.</p>

<p>If I would meet someone on a train trying to convince me of a way to do the perfect crime, I would just laugh it off, exactly like Guy Haines (Farley Granger) the young attractive tennis player. The main reason why killers are getting caught is motif. If you could take motif away, by swapping victims, so that no apparent connection exists between the two, you might improve your chances of getting away with it dramatically.</p>

<p>In the movie the conversation does not end at that, Bruno Antony (Robert Walker) goes ahead and kills the trampy wife of the tennis player, forcing him into a rough situation. Either return the favor or be accused of the murder himself.</p>

<p>Evaluating acting in a movie that is seventy years old is always a challenge as it is hard not to compare it to today’s movies. What might not be considered great acting by modern standards certainly is made up by the art of Alfred Hitchcock in suspense building. There are no explosions or CGI. What the movie does have is a good plot, and the viewer cannot help but sit on the edge of it’s seat the entire time. Every scene drives the story forward and every conversation adds and heightens the coming climax.</p>

<p>Although usually not considered on the same level as <a href="https://youtu.be/m01YktiEZCw">Rear Window (1954)</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5jvQwwHQNY">Vertigo (1958)</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/Wz719b9QUqY">Psycho (1960)</a> the movie is still a classic Alfred Hitchcock and I would recommend it especially for the more pronounced noir influences, it will certainly be a ride for everyone.</p>

        <p>I have gained an increasing interest in storytelling in recent years. Movies, novels and even poetry fuel my imagination with the potential they have to influence others. No other medium is a close to translating toughts from one person to another as the written word and more recently the moving pictures. I write movie reviews with a focus on European film, short stories and toughts.</p>
