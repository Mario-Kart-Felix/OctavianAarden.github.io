    <p>Jojo Rabbit is essentially a feel good movie that also tackles some deeper topics. Taika Waititi achieved a good result in portraying a horrible time in humanity’s recent history through the eyes off an innocent child.</p>

<p>Johannes is a 10 year old boy fascinated with the cause put forward by the Nazi propaganda machine in Germany during the final days of World War Two. He gets the nickname Jojo Rabbit after failing to kill a rabbit to show his dedication and fearlessness to said cause. Soon after that he discovers a Jewish girl hiding in his house, an event that slowly but surely changes his view on life and anti-semitism while he falls in love with the older girl. His supportive mother Rosie is the voice of reason in his life, while on the other shoulder he has an imaginary Hitler buffoon friend.</p>

<p>The movie does bring a lot of heart to the audience. We can see the damage war can have on an innocent child that has lost his father, his sister, and is on the way to lose even the last thing that helps him justify these pains that he has to endure: losing the role he has in the war effort as a junior Hitler youth member.</p>

<p>With great supporting character the movie swirls different themes around the boy with his mother being the seemingly only grounded realist support that he has. His imaginary friend is the blind fanaticism that Nazi manipulation asked for, while Yorki, his best friend and Captain Klenzendorf are skeptic believers at best, fed up with the fight still going forward from an inertial push of the system. On the opposing side is Elsa the Jewish girl that gives him a different perspective on life, death, pain, a first kiss and hope that everything can turn for the better. His own war is the battle to tell on Elsa, or even kill her while also not getting his mother in trouble for keeping a Jew safe.</p>

<p>The atmosphere throughout the movie is toy like, with bright colors and happy music, which is a great visual representation on the difference in perspective that a child can have compared to the more present and aware realization that an adult can have of the same event. In that regard most of <a href="https://youtu.be/BFwGqLa_oAo">The Pianist (2002)</a> has the feeling of a post apocalyptic world while Jojo Rabbit feel like a kids birthday party in a candy store, even tough both of the main characters lose almost everything in the war. This is good black comedic representation on the horrors of war and I would recommend it as a great feel good movie, that goes only deep enough in more painful themes to leave us with a happy feeling by the end of it.</p>

        <p>I have gained an increasing interest in storytelling in recent years. Movies, novels and even poetry fuel my imagination with the potential they have to influence others. No other medium is a close to translating toughts from one person to another as the written word and more recently the moving pictures. I write movie reviews with a focus on European film, short stories and toughts.</p>
