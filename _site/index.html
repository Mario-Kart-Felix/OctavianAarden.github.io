            Some movies just do not have a good story
          </a>
        </h3><p>As I have mentioned multiple times on twitter and here on my blog, I enjoy European film. The fact that the budgets are lower makes the movies made here a lot less dependent on the flashy stuff American films like to throw around like explosions and CGI.</p>

            The long trip to Venus - part I
          </a>
        </h3><p>As a child I always imagined that a trip to Venus would be blinding. Getting closer and closer to the Sun. The thought of having blinds did not occur to me, and maybe it was better that it did not. The real difficulty of such a long trip is the darkness of being alone for such a long time. Four months in a tiny cage is not what you would call a pleasant vacation.</p>

            Winning the crown of martyrdom
          </a>
        </h3><p>I had an idea about a zombie plague story where there is no difference between normal people and the infected, except for the lust for brains. They would be more similar to vampires rather than the classic zombies canon, as they would act in a rational and methodical way so that they are not discovered, thus killing in a more serial killer way than a horde of zombies attacking at first sight.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/Movie-theaters">
            Movie theaters
          </a>
        </h3><p>I am involved in a few communities related to movies. Regardless of the environment, there seems to be a prevailing opinion that movie theaters are the best medium to enjoy movies. We are not talking about the commercial, quick consumer fast-food movies. These are people that are into avantgarde movies, usually found in obscure theaters or only in the Criterion Collection. How far this is from my personal preferences.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">23 Nov, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/instinct-(2019)">
            Instinct (2019) – 2.5/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>Instinct is a Dutch movie which follows a power struggle between an experienced psychologist and a rapist inmate. If you expect a thriller, you might be disappointed as this is more of a female sexual fantasy movie than anything else.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">22 Nov, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/the-dead-dont-die-(2019)">
            The Dead Don’t Die (2019) – 2.5/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>The Dead Don’t Die is a zombie deadpan comedy that happens in a small American town. With an ensemble of stars in the film, it falls short off the expectations as the stories of the characters do not really connect.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">15 Nov, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/greenland-(2020)">
            Greenland (2020) – 3/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>In this disaster movie we see John Garrity (Gerald Butler) try to bring his estranged wife (Morena Baccarin) and his diabetic soon to safety. The main characters make bad decisions, there are logical black holes all through the movie, but all in all, a slightly bigger budget survival movie in the times of Coronavirus felt appropriate.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">8 Nov, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/vengeful-7-(2020)">
            Vengeful 7 (2020) – 1.5/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>Vengeful 7 or 7 Wrekers in its original Dutch title is a 2020 movie by Tristan van Doorn. If you guessed it is a Tarantino <a href="https://youtu.be/nIOmotayDMY">Hateful Eight (2015)</a> copy taking place in the Netherlands in WWII, but at a much lower quality, then you have guessed right.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">7 Nov, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/doctor-sleep-(2019)">
            Doctor Sleep (2019) – 3.5/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>I rewatched The Shining in anticipation for this film expecting Doctor Sleep to be horrible in comparison, but it stands pretty well on it’s own. It was a really entertaining suspense mystery.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">2 Nov, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/strangers-on-a-train-(1951)">
            Strangers on a Train (1951) – 3.5/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>Strangers on a Train is the quintessential Hitchcock suspense drama. What starts off as a chance encounter on a train between a tennis player and what we will later find out to be a psychopath, spirals down into a life, death or prison situation.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">1 Nov, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/ad-astra-(2019)">
            Ad Astra (2019) – 2.5/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>We have seen a lot of space dramas in the last ten years, <a href="https://youtu.be/OiTiKOy59o4">Gravity (2013)</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/zSWdZVtXT7E">Interstellar (2014)</a> come to mind of course. Ad Astra falls a bit short in comparison. A daring astronaut is a on a crucial mission to save earth (what else?) and find his father who has been missing in action after a mission to Neptune three decades before the events of the movie.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">24 Oct, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/magic-mountains-(2020)">
            Magic Mountains (2020) – 3/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>This Dutch movie by writer and director Urszula Antoniak is a testament to minimalism. Although predictable and leaving a feeling of incompleteness the movie was enjoyable and had some good moments.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">18 Oct, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/ford-v-ferrari-(2019)">
            Ford v Ferrari (2019) – 3/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>In this action packed movie, loosely based on the events leading up to the 1966 Le Mans race, we see the Ford Motor Company trying to gain notoriety in the racing world. On another level we see car designers and drivers searching for perfection in the design of the winning car.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">17 Oct, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/the-columnist-(2019)">
            The Columnist (2019) – 3.5/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>This Dutch movie directed by Ivo van Aart is a dark comedy that plays with the themes of freedom of speech, hate speech and the pleasure we get by trying to hurt, or in this case even kill others.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">14 Oct, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/gods-own-country-(2017)">
            God’s Own Country (2017) – 2.5/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>God’s Own Country is a romantic drama set in the farmlands of Yorkshire. It shows a battle for acceptance of one’s own sexuality as well as fighting to keep a farm alive and not destroy yourself because of lack of perspectives and dreams.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">11 Oct, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/jojo-rabbit-(2019)">
            Jojo Rabbit (2019) – 3.5/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>Jojo Rabbit is essentially a feel good movie that also tackles some deeper topics. Taika Waititi achieved a good result in portraying a horrible time in humanity’s recent history through the eyes off an innocent child.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">5 Oct, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/the-cremator-(1969)">
            The Cremator (1969) – 4.5/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>What starts out as an innocent but creepy movie, quickly turns into one of the most macabre social commentary films that I have seen. The movie by Juraj Herz follows a family man, cremator by trade, with his particular ideas on life and death, as is expected from a human that has to deal with death on a constant basis.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">4 Oct, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/branded-to-kill-(1967)">
            Branded to Kill (1967) – 3.5/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>Seijun Suzuki was fired by the studio after making this film. It was not appreciated in 1967, but it slowly became a cult classic and is now considered a highly influential movie of the New Japanese wave. In the Yakuza hitman genre, it is a film noir with absurdist elements, similar to the French movies of that period.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">23 Sep, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/paradise-drifters-(2020)">
            Paradise Drifters (2020) – 3/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>Mees Peijnenburg brings us a story about outcasts and how they balance on a cable between life, death and homelessness. While the movie is Dutch, is brings us along in Marseille and Barcelona, showing how the world can be just as cold as in rainy Netherlands.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">19 Sep, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/marriage-story-(2019)">
            Marriage Story (2019) – 4/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>A very solid movie written and directed by Noah Baumbach that analyses how one of life’s most unpleasant yet so common events can affect the protagonists. We follow the divorce and custody battle of a young and talented couple that happens in New York and Los Angeles.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">6 Sep, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/us-(2019)">
            Us (2019) – 2/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>Us is a mystery thriller by Jordan Peele about a family on vacation that is terrorized by an evil doppelganger family. While the summary is pretty succinct, it does describe the movie correctly, because everything else in it is forgettable or does not merit any extra attention.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">5 Sep, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/cries-and-whispers-(1972)">
            Cries and Whispers (1972) – 4/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>Ingmar Bergman delivers a drama about the struggles with mortality, loneliness, illness, cheating, ageing, lesbianism, faith, and many others, all set in a historical background. The story, which could have been a play, with an intense focus on the sinful color of red and face closeups keeps the profound style of Bergman, which has an incredible amount of biblical references, like most of his movies.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">4 Sep, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/pierrot-le-fou-(1965)">
            Pierrot le Fou (1965) – 4.5/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>If you are interested in a movie that blends in existentialism, the general feeling of life as an absurd event that dominated western Europe during the ’60s, all mixed together with beautiful blue and red colors, a Bonnie and Clyde story and the incredible humor and feeling given by the new french wave, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVvhJrrgfs0&amp;feature=emb_title">Pierrot le Fou</a> might be my first suggestion.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">3 Sep, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/the-autopsy-of-jane-doe-(2016)">
            The Autopsy of Jane Doe (2016) – 3/5
          </a>
        </h3><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtTAhXuiRTc">The Autopsy of Jane Doe</a> is a mystery supernatural horror that plays with one of human kinds worst fears, the dead and being close to them. The title basically gives away the plot of the movie: the local police force brings in a body and requests to have an autopsy by morning from the two coroners, a father and son played by Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">2 Sep, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/Gerald-s-Game-(2017)">
            Gerald’s Game (2017) – 2.5/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>While <a href="https://youtu.be/H3t_DuVHqBQ">Gerald’s Game</a> has been entertaining and has kept a bit of suspense until the very end, it is far from being a great movie. A middle aged couple go off for a weekend to try and spice up their marriage only for the husband (Gerald) to have a heart attack while the wife (Jessie) is still tied to the bed and that is where the second act and the weird stuff starts to happen. Weird in a bad way in the case of this movie.</p>
</li><li><span class="post-meta">1 Sep, 2020</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/Le-Week-end-(2013)">
            Le Week-end (2013) – 3.5/5
          </a>
        </h3><p>This British-French <a href="https://youtu.be/5DkFQKP1FUU">Le Week-end movie</a> takes us on a journey in Paris alongside an ageing British couple that try to rekindle their relationship with a weekend getaway in the city of love for their 30th anniversary.</p>
