        </h3><p>I had an idea about a zombie plague story where there is no difference between normal people and the infected, except for the lust for brains. They would be more similar to vampires rather than the classic zombies canon, as they would act in a rational and methodical way so that they are not discovered, thus killing in a more serial killer way than a horde of zombies attacking at first sight.</p>

            Movie theaters
          </a>
        </h3><p>I am involved in a few communities related to movies. Regardless of the environment, there seems to be a prevailing opinion that movie theaters are the best medium to enjoy movies. We are not talking about the commercial, quick consumer fast-food movies. These are people that are into avantgarde movies, usually found in obscure theaters or only in the Criterion Collection. How far this is from my personal preferences.</p>

        </h3><p>While <a href="https://youtu.be/H3t_DuVHqBQ">Gerald’s Game</a> has been entertaining and has kept a bit of suspense until the very end, it is far from being a great movie. A middle aged couple go off for a weekend to try and spice up their marriage only for the husband (Gerald) to have a heart attack while the wife (Jessie) is still tied to the bed and that is where the second act and the weird stuff starts to happen. Weird in a bad way in the case of this movie.</p>
