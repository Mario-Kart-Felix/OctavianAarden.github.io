    <p>Instinct is a Dutch movie which follows a power struggle between an experienced psychologist and a rapist inmate. If you expect a thriller, you might be disappointed as this is more of a female sexual fantasy movie than anything else.</p>

<p>Carive van Houten is in the main role in a new job at a prison where she has to counsel and asses inmates. There she meets a charismatic inmate (Marwan Kenzari) that seems to be able to manipulate the prison employees, especially the women, into giving him a chance at an unaccompanied probation. While she disagrees with the rest of the prisons psych staff that he should be allowed on probation, she slowly appears to fall under his charm, in part by probably having a chance at fulfilling a bad boy rape fantasy that she seems to have, more than because of his charms.</p>

<p>[SPOILERS] I have to give the two main actors credit for doing a good job at creating tension specific for a thriller movie, but in the end I feel that the movie is not a thriller, because of the revenge twist at the end, and is also not a pure drama because of the thriller aspects. It is neither and in the end that does not help the movie out.</p>

<p>The antagonist is a convicted rapist that tries to resist his urges, while showing that he has not really changed that much in his 5 years in prison. His main goal is to be released from prison, and not stopping from hurting other people for his personal sexual pleasure. He tries to get a new therapist, in part because he feels that the new one might not give him his parole, but in the end is seduced by her as much as the other way around, leading him to be in the same position at the end of the beginning as he was at the start. Still, a pretty good arc.</p>

<p>On the other hand the female psychologist is obviously not professional as she disregards multiple ethical rules in regards to her work, while actively trying to seduce an inmate she finds attractive to fulfill a sexual fantasy. As the movie progresses this of course backfires, when the inmate turns into an aggressive sexual offender again, but she gets her revenge for something that she actively initiated, which feels incredibly twisted for a movie that tries to end on a high moral note. Do stupid stuff, then just get some revenge and you will be ok kids.</p>

        <p>I have gained an increasing interest in storytelling in recent years. Movies, novels and even poetry fuel my imagination with the potential they have to influence others. No other medium is a close to translating toughts from one person to another as the written word and more recently the moving pictures. I write movie reviews with a focus on European film, short stories and toughts.</p>
