<h4 id="what-makes-you-a-critic">What makes you a critic?</h4>
<p>I have a passion for storytelling and film in particular and I enjoy writing about it. I am not licensed in any official way to be a critic.</p>

<h4 id="do-you-have-formal-education-in-comparative-writingjournalismcreative-writingetc">Do you have formal education in comparative writing/journalism/creative writing/etc?</h4>
<p>I do not, I am an engineer by trade this is a personal passion of mine.</p>

<h4 id="do-your-reviews-contain-spoilers">Do your reviews contain spoilers?</h4>
<p>They probably do. This will not be a movie review website that should help you decide to watch the movie or not. My idea is to try and talk about the different aspects of the movie after I, and the reader, have seen it already we try to make sense of it.</p>

<h4 id="do-you-writeaccept-guest-posts">Do you write/accept guest posts?</h4>
<p>Sure, if I feel there is a stylistic match.</p>
