    <p>This Dutch movie directed by Ivo van Aart is a dark comedy that plays with the themes of freedom of speech, hate speech and the pleasure we get by trying to hurt, or in this case even kill others.</p>

<p>Femke Boot (Katja Herbers) is a columnist for de Volkskrant, one of Netherlands biggest newspapers. With that public image, television shows invitations and book deals, comes also some negative attention. While her initial rival turned lover Steven Dood (Bam van der Kelen) manages to ignore the internet trolls, the main characters is not able to stay away from social media and from checking the comments related to her. This turns her in a psycho that hunts and kills trolls and we can see strong influences from American Psycho (2000). The movie also plays with the hypocrisy of supporting her daughter’s (Claire Porro) free speech initiative for school but also finding pleasure in hurting and killing others for what they said. It all makes her feel alive and productive, probably in a similar way as a distasteful comment left online would.</p>

<p>While the movie shows themes of misogyny, the killed trolls being exclusively men, this is turned around in the end. The columnist turns from a killer that you can root for because of the revenge porn aspect, into a murderer that takes innocent lives as well, as long as they are men or get in the way of her new found pleasure.</p>

<p>The acting from the main trio is excellent, the characters are interesting and the story is funny while the gruesome stuff stays pretty tame in comparison with the vulgar language, the Dutch original title of De Kuthoer meaning being literally cunt whore. While staying suspenseful throughout, the movie is entertaining while not really achieving cult status, but it is a great watch nonetheless.</p>

        <p>I have gained an increasing interest in storytelling in recent years. Movies, novels and even poetry fuel my imagination with the potential they have to influence others. No other medium is a close to translating toughts from one person to another as the written word and more recently the moving pictures. I write movie reviews with a focus on European film, short stories and toughts.</p>
