    <h2 id="lavalens">LavaLens</h2>

<p>The immediate objective of LavaLens is to provide an outlet for itâ€™s creator, Octavian Aarden. Being a European movie fan and also enjoying writing, reading and studying the influence the written word has on society, I started this page as an outlet for myself. The name of the website is a wordplay on lava and the movie lens that captures the actors and out imagination.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/00_OctavianAarden.png" alt="Octavian Aarden caricature" /></p>

<h2 id="octavian-aarden">Octavian Aarden</h2>

<p>Octavian Aarden is the creator of LavaLens and a young European film enthusiast living in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. A long-term lover of non-blockbuster movies, he is a fan of post-apocalyptic sci-fi, historical fiction and zombies.</p>

<p>Trained as an engineer, movie watching and movie critique remain his first passion.</p>
