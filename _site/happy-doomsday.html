<p>I have not been stressed in months. I feel at ease with myself. Working the field for a few weeks a year and gathering fire wood are my only concerns. The zombies are slow, you just need to crush their heads if you come in contact with them. Otherwise I do not have any worry in the world. There is no power struggle in our community as we are all heavily armed. If there is an attempt to gain power and somehow use the rest as slave workers, that would quickly end in death for one team. In that regard we are closer in organization to an anarchist commune from before the end of the world, just with lots of weapons.</p>

<p>Remembering how many nights I had struggled to fall asleep because I did not finished a report for work, it all seems like a bad dream. How could I have that much in my life at that point, all the comforts that only kings had for centuries and still fell so unhappy? Here I am reading, napping every day. I play the guitar for at least an hour every evening, something that I always wanted to do but never did. I do need to work in the field so that we can have fresh food for the future, but that only takes less than two or three hours a day. Even if all my crops go to waste for a reason or another, I can still make some scavenging trips and get enough food to live for years.</p>

<p>Yes, there might come a time when the modern wonders of medicine will be missed, but right now, as I am in good health, that seems like a far away possibility maybe decades in the future. At that point you can see life as coming to itâ€™s natural end. It can happen before, but if seven billion dead has thought us something, it is that we should enjoy life when we can, and when the end comes let it come. Nothing to be sad about.</p>

<p>I keep coming back to my initial idea of the differences in life quality between now and three years ago. I was eating bad food, because I always found stress to be the perfect excuse for a bad diet. Balding, getting fat. I had a gym membership to make myself feel good but I never went. Shitty Netflix shows to dumb the mind after twelve hours at the office, mortgage payments, social engagements where you do not want to be. I hated even having to call my parents. If I knew that I can exchange all the stress of a modern office job for a bit of manual labor and shitting in a hole in the ground in a wooden closet, I would have taken the later any day.</p>
