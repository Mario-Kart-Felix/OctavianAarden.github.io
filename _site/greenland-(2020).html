    <p>In this disaster movie we see John Garrity (Gerald Butler) try to bring his estranged wife (Morena Baccarin) and his diabetic soon to safety. The main characters make bad decisions, there are logical black holes all through the movie, but all in all, a slightly bigger budget survival movie in the times of Coronavirus felt appropriate.</p>

<p>I personally like disaster movies, and my enjoyment of this one might be a bit more pronounced than for the general public. I could see mediocre writing all throughout the movie, and I will also admit that at some point I was hoping for the hysterical wife to die, just to make the movie better, but unfortunately that did not happen and we got a happy ending. One of the more obvious plot holes is the fact that society had already fallen into panic, but they still somehow managed to drive hundreds of miles, which would require them to refuel multiple times along the way, especially with those huge Americans cars that eat up gasoline like crazy.</p>

<p>[SPOILERS] The movie has a side plot of the husband trying to rekindle the relationship, which I think was totally unnecessary, as the anxiety of the world being destroyed is enough to keep the viewers entertained, having to worry about them not getting back together seems to only tame the main concern of survival. But like all good Hollywood movies they seem to be happy together by the third act and also on the way to live another day.</p>

<p>In terms of technical achievement there is nothing wrong with the movie. Acting could have been better, but then again, this is not the kind of movie that goes for nominations for best acting. My personal preference is to see the dark human transformation from regular person to complete animal that would do everything for survival. That theme is touched on in this movie but could have been developed a lot more, instead of the stale we broke up and I immediately slept with someone else scene they decided to put in. In the end, the main achievement of the film is to give us a distraction from Coronavirus for 2 hours.</p>

        <p>I have gained an increasing interest in storytelling in recent years. Movies, novels and even poetry fuel my imagination with the potential they have to influence others. No other medium is a close to translating toughts from one person to another as the written word and more recently the moving pictures. I write movie reviews with a focus on European film, short stories and toughts.</p>
