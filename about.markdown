## LavaLens

The immediate objective of LavaLens is to provide an outlet for itâ€™s creator, Octavian Aarden. Being a European movie fan and also enjoying writing, creating a movie critique website seemed like a natural progression.


## Octavian Aarden

Octavian Aarden is the creator of LavaLens and a young European film enthusiast living in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. A long-term lover of non-blockbuster movies, he is a fan of post-apocalyptic sci-fi, historical fiction and zombies.
