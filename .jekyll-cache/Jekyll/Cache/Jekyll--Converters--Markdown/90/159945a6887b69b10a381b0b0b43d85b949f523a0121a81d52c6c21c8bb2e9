I"Ä<p>We have seen a lot of space dramas in the last ten years, <a href="https://youtu.be/OiTiKOy59o4">Gravity (2013)</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/zSWdZVtXT7E">Interstellar (2014)</a> come to mind of course. Ad Astra falls a bit short in comparison. A daring astronaut is a on a crucial mission to save earth (what else?) and find his father who has been missing in action after a mission to Neptune three decades before the events of the movie.</p>
