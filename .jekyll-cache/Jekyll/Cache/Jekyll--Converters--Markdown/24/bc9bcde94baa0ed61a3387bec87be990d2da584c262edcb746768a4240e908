I"r<p>I have not been stressed in months. I feel at ease with myself. Working the field for a few weeks a year and gathering fire wood are my only concerns. The zombies are slow, you just need to crush their heads if you come in contact with them. Otherwise I do not have any worry in the world. There is no power struggle in our community as we are all heavily armed. If there is an attempt to gain power and somehow use the rest as slave workers, that would quickly end in death for one team. In that regard we are closer in organization to an anarchist commune from before the end of the world, just with lots of weapons.</p>
