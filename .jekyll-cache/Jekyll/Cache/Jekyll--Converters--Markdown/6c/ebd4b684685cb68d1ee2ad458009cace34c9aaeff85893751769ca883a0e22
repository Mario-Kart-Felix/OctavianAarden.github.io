I"×<p>The Dead Donâ€™t Die is a zombie deadpan comedy that happens in a small American town. With an ensemble of stars in the film, it falls short off the expectations as the stories of the characters do not really connect.</p>

<p>I think the anticipation for this movie was great as more and more stars were added to the list of people that will take part in Jim Jarmuschâ€™s movie. I was certainly excited, expecting an American equivalent to <a href="https://youtu.be/LIfcaZ4pC-4">Shaun of the Dead (2004)</a> or even a new ZomCom on par with <a href="https://youtu.be/8m9EVP8X7N8">Zombieland (2009)</a>, but unfortunately it was not. The movie falls short in the story area because of the huge cast and the attempt to give them all air time, but at the end of the movie we see that the arcs are not really interconnected.</p>

<p>As an example, there is a big portion of the film spent on a group of what seems to be a trio of runaways from the big city lead by Selena Gomez, that just does not lead to anything or pushes the story forward in any way. And this is not an isolated case, it just keeps going forward with small characters all the way to the end, with no reasonable way to close it all in a satisfying way.</p>

<p>What the movie does in a pretty good way is the deadpan humor, with dark comedy influences all along the way. We see two small town cops played by Bill Murray and Adam Driver, who just canâ€™t be bothered to panic or turn on their machismo to fight of the zombies. It is just another day at the office for them, which is pretty funny and comes in contrast with Shaun of the Dead, where Shaun tries to save the day to win his girlfriend back.</p>

<p>The biggest flaw remains the fact that we follow too many of the characters throughout the movie, which gives the story a very scattered feeling and does help us to connect with any of them. I think the movie might have benefited a lot from a smaller ensemble of stars, which would have led to each of them having more screen time and thus the possibility of of tidying all the smaller stories together. My advice for this one is to skip it if you are not a real comedy zombie movies fan.</p>
