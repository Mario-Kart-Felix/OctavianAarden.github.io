<p>Vengeful 7 or 7 Wrekers in its original Dutch title is a 2020 movie by Tristan van Doorn. If you guessed it is a Tarantino <a href="https://youtu.be/nIOmotayDMY">Hateful Eight (2015)</a> copy taking place in the Netherlands in WWII, but at a much lower quality, then you have guessed right.</p>

<p>As all the action takes place in a single room, and the image keeps getting out of focus during the film, my guess is that the movie was filmed on basically no budget and a tight schedule. Tristan van Doorn, the writer, director, producer, cameraman and so on, usually does shorts under his own independent film company named Doorn Eden Films. From what I could find this is his first feature length film, and indeed you can see that.</p>

<p>The acting is pretty bad, the set is minimalist, everything taking place in one room and you can see the influence of The Hateful Eight at every turn, that is to be gentle and not call it a ripoff. With a story that has a lot of twists we see the resistance fighters against the Nazis, which is a really abused subject in Dutch movies. A couple of higher quality alternatives would be <a href="https://youtu.be/7APEb3ngkpk">Black Book (Zwartboek 2006)</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/xyUeBQf4dP8">Riphagen (2016)</a> if the subject is interesting to the readers.</p>

<p>In this case particular film, the limit between amateur film and professional film is really hard to distinguish. As the man behind this movie is still young, I hope that this was a learning experience for him, but at this moment in time, Vengeful 7 was more of a comedy in how bad it was than a real war drama.</p>
