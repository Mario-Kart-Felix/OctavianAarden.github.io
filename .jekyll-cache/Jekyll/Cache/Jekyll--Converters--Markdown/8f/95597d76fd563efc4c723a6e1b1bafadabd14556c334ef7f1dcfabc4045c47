<p>Seijun Suzuki was fired by the studio after making this film. It was not appreciated in 1967, but it slowly became a cult classic and is now considered a highly influential movie of the New Japanese wave. In the Yakuza hitman genre, it is a film noir with absurdist elements, similar to the French movies of that period.</p>

<p>Initially not appreciated, because ‚Äúit makes no money and no sense‚Äù, the movie has cinematic qualities especially in the lightning and tension building departments, and although it almost destroyed Suzuki‚Äôs career, it finally came through and has received the recognition that it deserves, unfortunately only decades after premiering.</p>

<p>The main protagonist is a contract killer named Hanada, played by Joe Shishido, a James Bond like figure, made to look like a caricature by the director and his artificial enlarged cheekbones. After falling in love with a femme fatale named Misako (Annu Mari), he accepts an ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù job from her only to fail and be hunted himself, all leading to final stand off with the No.1 listed killer of the Japanese mob.</p>

<p>Drinking abounds in the movie, which makes the hitman even more confused about life, love, betrayal and his place in the world, currently being ranked as No.3 killer in the organization. His love life is also strangely violent and erotic and his passion can only be triggered by smelling boiled rice. The lead woman is obsessed with death, her only wish being that of dying and in that pursuit she fuels her fetish by surrounding herself with dead butterflies and dead birds.</p>

<p>Through the movie I had the feeling of always being on the edge between seeing a satire playing on the French avant-garde (similar to Pierrot le Fou) paired with spy and detective noir movies of the Western world at the time. My only conclusion is that entertainment won, and the writer confirmed in a later interview that his decisions where indeed guided by making it as entertaining as possible. I would advise watching the movie with no expectations except for being entertained, it does achieve that easily, even tough some themes and the plot could have probably been improved with more time and budget.</p>
