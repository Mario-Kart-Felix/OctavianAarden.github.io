I"X<p>In this disaster movie we see John Garrity (Gerald Butler) try to bring his estranged wife (Morena Baccarin) and his diabetic soon to safety. The main characters make bad decisions, there are logical black holes all through the movie, but all in all, a slightly bigger budget survival movie in the times of Coronavirus felt appropriate.</p>
