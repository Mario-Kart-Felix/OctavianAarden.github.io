<p>The immediate objective of LavaLens is to provide an outlet for itâ€™s creator, Octavian Aarden. Being a European movie fan and also enjoying writing, reading and studying the influence the written word has on society, I started this page as an outlet for myself. The name of the website is a wordplay on lava and the movie lens that captures the actors and out imagination.</p>
