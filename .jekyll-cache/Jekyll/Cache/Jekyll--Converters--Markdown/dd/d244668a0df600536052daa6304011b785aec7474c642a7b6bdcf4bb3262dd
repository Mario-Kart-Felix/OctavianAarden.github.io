I"Ý<p>While <a href="https://youtu.be/H3t_DuVHqBQ">Geraldâ€™s Game</a> has been entertaining and has kept a bit of suspense until the very end, it is far from being a great movie. A middle aged couple go off for a weekend to try and spice up their marriage only for the husband (Gerald) to have a heart attack while the wife (Jessie) is still tied to the bed and that is where the second act and the weird stuff starts to happen. Weird in a bad way in the case of this movie.</p>
