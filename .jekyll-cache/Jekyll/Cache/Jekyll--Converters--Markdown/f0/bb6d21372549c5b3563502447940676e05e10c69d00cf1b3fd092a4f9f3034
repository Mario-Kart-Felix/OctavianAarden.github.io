I"d	<p>A very solid movie written and directed by Noah Baumbach that analyses how one of lifeâ€™s most unpleasant yet so common events can affect the protagonists. We follow the divorce and custody battle of a young and talented couple that happens in New York and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The plot is simple yet powerful. We follow the husband, played remarkably well by Adam Driver, an up and coming theater director from New York. On the other side, we have the wife played by Scarlett Johansson who wants to pursue her own career in television on the west coast of America. In the middle is Henry, a toddler that gets increasingly annoyed by his parents battle and that can be seen in him misbehaving as the movie moves along.</p>

<p>While the couple agrees to have a civil split, it all turns worse and worse when the wife hires an aggressive divorce lawyer that seems to also be a part time therapist for the character. The lawyer is played by Laura Dern and the role has gotten her an academy award for best supporting actress although I do not see the full merits on this one. We keep moving forward between NY and LA until we have two moments with sequential culminating moments: one in the court where the aggressive lawyers bark at each other and one when they meet alone to have a discussion which turns into a heated argument with all the frustration is coming out. These scenes also ultimately show the differences in the actions of the former couple, which are brought to light in court, and the feelings that are boiling inside them.</p>

<p>Throughout the film we see different themes, one that is exceedingly present in modern society is the difficulty in following the ambitions of two talented individuals in respect to geographical proximity, in this case on the east and west coasts. Both the husband and the wife have made mistakes that led to the divorce, but the movie ends with us seeing the woman fruitfully coming into a career of herself after freeing herself from marriage and the man struggling to be close to his child. This is a solid movie about the disintegration of love, driven by great performances and it falls in the same small scale struggles of human beings that seems to have been rekindled recently for big awards by <a href="https://youtu.be/sKVYRtE-kXI">Roma (2018)</a>.</p>
