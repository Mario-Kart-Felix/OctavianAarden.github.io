<p>Being on death row means you have a lot of time to think. You think about what your life means. You think about what you could do on the outside. I was sentenced a decade ago. There are no doubts about my conviction, I am guilty. I know it and the justice system knows it. What I do not know is how I managed to kill someone.</p>

<p>If I am honest with myself and with you reader, I think I even thought that it would be cool to be a killer. A predator. People would be afraid of me, what can be cooler than that? What you do not know is that being cool but on death row has absolutely no benefit.</p>

<p>You have time in here. Nothing but time. You can do some workouts in your cell, walk around when they take you outside. Another thing that I thought about before my crime was that sitting in a cell and reading books might be a lot more relaxing than having a job and being stressed. What I did not know is that my situation is never going out of your mind. Even if they cancel my executing for some reason, and there is a big chance for that, I will still live all my life in a cell. No work stress, no vacation and no family. I will be forever in a cell. Nothing can change that. Knowing this is the real punishment.</p>

<p>Correction facilities should correct the behavior of the inmates. It should be an unpleasant experience that will prevent them from repeating their actions after they are released. In my case and in the case of others on death row there is no release. We are here to prevent us from going out in society again. We are here as an example of what happens if we do not adhere to societies rules. It is all understandable, I don‚Äôt think the system is all that bad. If I had taken a different path in life, I would probably still support life in prison and executions. What I am interested in now are the effects this has on the human mind. Yes, we have done horrible things. Yes we are a danger to society and should be used as examples. On the other hand keeping a person looked up until they eventually die, by old age, execution or suicide seems to defeat the purpose of them being alive. What is the point?</p>

<p>Was there at any point in time in the past a person on death row that still did something meaningful with his life? Wrote a good poem. Played incredible correspondence chess? Or is it just torture until an eventual death?</p>
