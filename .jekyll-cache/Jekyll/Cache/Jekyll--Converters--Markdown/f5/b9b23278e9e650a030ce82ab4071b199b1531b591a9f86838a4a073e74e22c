I"<p>Ingmar Bergman delivers a drama about the struggles with mortality, loneliness, illness, cheating, ageing, lesbianism, faith, and many others, all set in a historical background. The story, which could have been a play, with an intense focus on the sinful color of red and face closeups keeps the profound style of Bergman, which has an incredible amount of biblical references, like most of his movies.</p>

<p>The background of the story is set in what seems to be a beautiful Swedish château around 1900. Three sisters reunite because one of them is terminally ill and this makes all the past trauma and their need for bonding or distancing boil out, as they are forced to spend the days in close contact. Anna, the servant, is closer to the dying Agnes than the other sisters and represents the struggle of a woman with no material means and independence. The rich sisters do not have any financial needs but they are still miserable for different reasons. Agnes feels her death approaching and by seeing her sister Maria remembers the abandonment she felt as a child from their mother. Maria struggles with sexuality and need for passion and wants to get closer to the third sister Karin. Karin is played by Ingrid Thulin, which delivers and incredible performance, and seems to be the most tormented of them all, having no desire to be close to the other sisters, or even her husband, while having a character development that makes her open up her views only to feel betrayed again by the end.</p>

<p>Blood, wine, an apple, the carpets etc, all dramatically play with a saturated red color that stand for an incredible variety of themes and I think that comes with no surprise to anyone that has gotten acquainted with Bergman. One thing that is also fascinating is the depiction of women which was very modern for the ’70s. Lesbianism is suggested, although there is a slim doubt left to the fact of it really happening between the dying sister and the maid. Cheating and sexuality are expressed with no hidden details left out. Men on the other hand are seen as rigid and self contained and only take part in the drama of the sisters in a superficial way, even tough they also pass through emotional struggles, like living in sexless marriages where the wife would rather inflict self harm than make love, being cheated on or the priest who seems to struggle with belief himself.</p>

<p>Get ready to be uncomfortable with this film and for a lot of face close ups that add to the tension. The claustrophobia is palpable and will make you want to look away, but you will not be able to do it, the same way the characters cannot escape the situations in which they are in, or their past.</p>
