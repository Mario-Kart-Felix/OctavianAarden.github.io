I"«<p>If you are interested in a movie that blends in existentialism, the general feeling of life as an absurd event that dominated western Europe during the â€™60s, all mixed together with beautiful blue and red colors, a Bonnie and Clyde story and the incredible humor and feeling given by the new french wave, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVvhJrrgfs0&amp;feature=emb_title">Pierrot le Fou</a> might be my first suggestion.</p>

<p>The writer and director, Jean-Luc Godard, tells a chaotic story that moves quickly between scenes but still manages to have a plot that makes sense and keeps the viewer intrigued. It all starts off with Pierrot/Ferdinand, played incredibly well by Jean-Paul Belmondo, a middle aged Parisian that goes through the existential crisis from which only a search for excitement and adventure can knock you back to your senses. As such he runs off with his babysitter Marianne (Anna Karina), feeling that he has nothing to lose anyway and living for excitement might give him a reason to keep on living.</p>

<p>The love story drives the plot up until the final moments of the movie, but it is hard not to notice the divide between the main characters, who seem to be more in love with their adventure than with each other. They are on the run from gun traffickers, which seem to be a second or third priority for them, as throughout the film they are afraid of boredom, or of losing Pierrotâ€™s journal, more than anything else.</p>

<p>In pure Nouvelle Vague style seemingly random art references, songs and poetry spread out through everything. The Vietnam war also makes important appearances in the film, but it only amplifies the sensation that the world and all the troubles in it are only secondary to the fear of going back to a bourgeois boring soulless life that plagued the upper middle class.</p>

<p>When the couple ends up on the southern coast of France, life fights to find meaning and beauty in itself, while in Paris it is just living 250 billion seconds until it ends, as Marianne observes. This is also an incredible self aware idea the movie has in comparing the French new wave with the established movie making standards from Hollywood at that time.</p>
