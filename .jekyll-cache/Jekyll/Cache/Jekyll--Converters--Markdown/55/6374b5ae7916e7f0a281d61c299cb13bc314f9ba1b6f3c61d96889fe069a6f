I"<p>This Dutch movie by writer and director Urszula Antoniak is a testament to minimalism. Although predictable and leaving a feeling of incompleteness the movie was enjoyable and had some good moments.</p>

<p>A published, successful, stalking writer convinces his ex to go with him on a last climbing trip in the Polish mountains. While there, the tension builds as suspicion grows and the intentions to kill are becoming more obvious as it is revealed that the trip might be more dangerous and suicidal than initially thought by his ex. They are also accompanied by the mountaineering guide who seems to feel the danger of the crime that might happen and tries to pursue them and save the girl if there is a need.</p>

<p>The trio has a weird connection, with jealousy, attraction, drink and love of mountains between them. The sexual energy between them might have added a bit more to the story if the implied intention of the writer to kill his ex girlfriend, or in the terms of the movie to ‚Äúlet her go‚Äù, might have been replaced with the intention to win her back. As the story unfolds it does not have as much benefit.</p>

<p>In a three actor movie I would have expected a lot more character development but I was surprised to find that is not the case. The movie still manages to keep suspense throughout and that made is enjoyable and I think nature and mountain lovers will find the beautiful shots delightful.</p>
