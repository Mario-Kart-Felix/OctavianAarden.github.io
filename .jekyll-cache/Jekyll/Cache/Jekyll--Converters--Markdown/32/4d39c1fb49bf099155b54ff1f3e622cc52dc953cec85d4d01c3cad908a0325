I"­<p>I am involved in a few communities related to movies. Regardless of the environment, there seems to be a prevailing opinion that movie theaters are the best medium to enjoy movies. We are not talking about the commercial, quick consumer fast-food movies. These are people that are into avantgarde movies, usually found in obscure theaters or only in the Criterion Collection. How far this is from my personal preferences.</p>
