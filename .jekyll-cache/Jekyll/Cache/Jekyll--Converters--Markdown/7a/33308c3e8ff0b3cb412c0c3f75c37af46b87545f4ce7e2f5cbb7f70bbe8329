I"'<p>There is a common desire among my friends, a dream to stop working. A dream to be independent, to not have a job. Less money would be ok as long as we would not have to do something that we do not want for 40 50 60 hours every week. Not many try to do something about this. The closest most might get to this is to start a business. You might end up working even more than before, but at least you gain a lot of independence. That also depends on how you see it. You change your boss for your customers, and a secure paycheck for extra stress.</p>
