I"î<p>I rewatched The Shining in anticipation for this film expecting Doctor Sleep to be horrible in comparison, but it stands pretty well on itâ€™s own. It was a really entertaining suspense mystery.</p>

<p>We follow a middle aged Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor), who struggles with alcoholism and the demons of his past, after the events at Overlook Hotel when he was a child. As it seems the shine that he has is more widespread than initially thought, and there are not only good guys that posses it but also bad guys. He gets in contact with a little girl named Abra (Kyliegh Curran), who being very enthusiastic about her new found power explores itâ€™s limits as much as possible.</p>

<p>A cat and mouse game starts when the little girl crosses a telepathic path with a bunch of what seems to be qvasi-vampires, that feed on the souls of others. It all unfolds until self sacrifice and redemption are fulfilled by giving something to the next generation: a chance at life. I will not try to make the story seem more complicated or incredible than it was, but even in itâ€™s simple form, it was good screenwriting and when screenwriting makes it to the screen it is hard not to be entertained.</p>

<p>The characters are all interesting and well written, especially Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson) as a hippie femme-fatale final boss. The mix that the soul sucking vampires form is one of the strong points of the movie, and it does not feel forced, as it often is in groups of mixed villains.</p>

<p>Along the way there is a lot of The Shining fan nostalgia, but this movie has itâ€™s own spirit and in that regard I do not see these fan triggers as a fault. It ties in with itâ€™s predecessor well, but it will probably not be remembered as a masterpiece. The director Mike Flanagan did a good job in most regards but as mentioned before, when comparing it with Kubrickâ€™s film it does lack a bit of quality to become a fan favorite with cult following. Nonetheless it was pure entertainment and I would recommend it to the mystery suspense fans. For the hardcore horror movie lovers, maybe search for something a bit more aggressive as this one is pretty tame in the scary department.</p>
