I"H<p>What starts out as an innocent but creepy movie, quickly turns into one of the most macabre social commentary films that I have seen. The movie by Juraj Herz follows a family man, cremator by trade, with his particular ideas on life and death, as is expected from a human that has to deal with death on a constant basis.</p>
