I"›<p>Ingmar Bergman delivers a drama about the struggles with mortality, loneliness, illness, cheating, ageing, lesbianism, faith, and many others, all set in a historical background. The story, which could have been a play, with an intense focus on the sinful color of red and face closeups keeps the profound style of Bergman, which has an incredible amount of biblical references, like most of his movies.</p>
