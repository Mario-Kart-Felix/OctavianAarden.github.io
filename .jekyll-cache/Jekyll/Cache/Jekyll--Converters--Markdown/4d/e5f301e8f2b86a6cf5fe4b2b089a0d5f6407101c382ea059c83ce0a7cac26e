<p>Mees Peijnenburg brings us a story about outcasts and how they balance on a cable between life, death and homelessness. While the movie is Dutch, is brings us along in Marseille and Barcelona, showing how the world can be just as cold as in rainy Netherlands.</p>

<p>Through the movie we see countless scenes where card boards have been carefully set in place by the invisible homeless people around us, suggesting that the main characters are always on the brink of living on the streets. A young man is just released from a foster home and is now all alone on the streets and in the world. A pregnant female runs away from her rapist and from her mother, while the third character, another young man, wants to do a risky transaction to have enough money to support his brother upon release from prison.</p>

<p>As they navigate their chance encounter, they all fight with inner demons, having nothing in common except for the danger, depression, loneliness and being at the outer edge of society. We follow them through different adventures and in the end they all have to make difficult decisions, regarding betrayal, family, and most importantly life and the decision of ending it. They do not only have bad moments along the way, we see them enjoying a luxury hotel, or having the satisfaction of a financially changed life after a dangerous illegal deal, but they always quickly go back to being in trouble.</p>

<p>The actors deliver strong performances, which has gained recognition at European festivals and it is easy to see why, they are not playing easy parts. Showing different cities across Europe also brings an added layer of stress as the group does not speak French or Spanish while they are outside of the Netherlands. In the end we have a conclusion that puts screams of pain and death in balance with the screams of joy for still being alive.</p>
