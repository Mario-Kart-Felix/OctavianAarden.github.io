I"	<p>God’s Own Country is a romantic drama set in the farmlands of Yorkshire. It shows a battle for acceptance of one’s own sexuality as well as fighting to keep a farm alive and not destroy yourself because of lack of perspectives and dreams.</p>

<p>Johnny is a tough farm boy that lives with his father and his grandmother. He spends his days working hard on the farm, while binge drinking at the local pub and having casual sex with other men in a cycle that seems to have no exit or possibility of improvement for him. In a scene at the local pub we also see his chatting with one of his former friends, most of which have gone on in search of better lives far away from the farmlands.</p>

<p>While needing help on the farm their hire a migrant worker from Romania to help out. A passionate love story begins between the two of them fueled by attraction, hard work and the boiled aggressive sexuality that Johnny tries to keep down in himself.</p>

<p>While the first act shows the dire life on a farm and quietly reveals the characters to us, the second and also the third act seem to slowly drop in quality. The two lovers go between getting to know each other, falling in love and accepting themselves, to having a fight ignited by the stress provoked by Johnny’s father having a stroke. Finally the hard uncompromising family suddenly accepts that love, even in a gay form, because it might be what the boy needs to stay there and to keep going.</p>

<p>We see multiple themes in the movie, the first act is dominated by the struggle to cope with the family’s desires instead of focusing on one own life. We quickly move on to the overcoming of loneliness but also joys of the farm life, racism and falling in love in the second act. The film closes with a third act in which the main protagonist is indeed changed to a person that learns to say what he feels and what he wants, to himself, his family and his lover. Unfortunately, while the movie is well executed is it extremely forgettable and the story has nothing shining out. The viewer would be better off just watching <a href="https://youtu.be/XH-axJYjx10">Brokeback Mountain (2005)</a>, because this movie falls short of being a really good one.</p>
