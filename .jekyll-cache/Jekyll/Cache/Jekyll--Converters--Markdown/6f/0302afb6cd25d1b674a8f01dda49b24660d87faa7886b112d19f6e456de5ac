<p>There is a plague of tough unrealistic women in Hollywood. There are countless accounts of women in modern media that are so uni dimensional that the only way they can show strength and independence is by beating up men twice or three times as big as them. This is not realistic and immediately makes me disconnect from a movie.</p>

<p>There are many ways to show strength, most of them independent of the sex of the characters and of their size. We do not need to have super hero level powers in every movie out there. Leads do not have to immediately command loyalty or fear from everybody. They do not need to be able to overpower all their enemies and show how tough their are with every action.</p>

<p>I think of film as an art form, and not necessarily as an educational channel. Still, I can think of many examples of strong women and film that can be wonderful examples for young girls and boys, to show them that women can be as tough as men. Ripley from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(franchise)">Alien franchise</a> or Clarice Starling from <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0102926/">Silence of the Lambs</a> are incredible leads. You can make anyone strong by showing how they act under pressure. Being able to only show how strong your female character is by beating up men is just bad writing. They need to work to increase their skill, that will earn the respect of the other characters, and of the audience.</p>
